* Randomly select 50% of users (new and existing) to participate in the native promotional treatment
* The test is controlled by a traditional configuration experiment. We can easily enable or disable the test remotely.
* The test will only apply to english language versions of the iOS products
* This experiment applies to all users - users enrolled will stop receiving Braze messages and begin getting App Man messages.
* The onboarding sale will only apply to new users since it is an onboarding sale.
* Existing users with a running sale will continue that sale. When the sale is complete, they will begin receiving non sale messages.
* Existing users with no sale running will receive non sale messages
* The Periodic sale will start as soon as its criteria are satisfied (non sale message has been shown, 9 days of foods logged). For some users the periodic sale may be offered immediately.

* If a free user enrolled in this experiment, they will not receive any Braze in-app messages. All in-app messaging targeting free users is implemented by App Man.
* Existing push and email campaigns will still be delivered from Braze. Any Braze campaigns that depend upon a specific in-app message being shown will not be delivered to users in this experiment since it is discarding all in-app messages from Braze.
* Messages that target premium users (e.g. lifetime) will still be delivered.
* No change to existing campaigns are required- the behavior will be managed entirely by App Man.
* The promotions respect the client behavior of the countdown timer including showing the countdown timer and not showing promotional pop ups while the timer is visible.",12.2.700,74f6b423-fac4-4ad3-b925-e2e9d97fcb50
